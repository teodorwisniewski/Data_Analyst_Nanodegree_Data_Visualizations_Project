# Ford GoBike System Data exploration 
> This simple analysis will explore data of the Ford GoBike System Data. We will use descriptive statistics and visualization in order to draw some useful information about this dataset. This project is created for Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree Programme.


## About the dataset

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place.



## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
One may find the exploratory data analysis in the following file:
```sh
part1_exploratory _Ford_GoBike.ipynb
```
In order to analyze bike rental system, basic statistical tools and visualisations have been used. In order to properly use training dataset, initial Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was carried out. This dataset contains 183412 rows (rows with missing values counted).
It allowed to learn more about the dataset and explore different features.  In this part, the following features will be studied:
* age
* starting hour of the trip
* usage of bikes on different week days
* distance between starting and ending stations in km

## Explanatory data analysis
One may find the explanatory data analysis in the following file:
```sh
part2_explanatory_Ford_GoBike.ipynb
```
The EDA phase was followed by the explanatory data analysis consisting of the features engineering process. It allowed to draw several useful insights about the dataset and give some general recommendations regarding the usage of the system. We will find out that a typical user is a male who subscribes bikes system and who probably works and is between 25-50 years old. We suggest to create an app to motivate users through the gamification of the bike riding process.
